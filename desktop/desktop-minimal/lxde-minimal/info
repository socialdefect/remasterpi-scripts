LXDE is the standard desktop environment on Raspbian (and a lot more OS).
It's build on top of OpenBox and it is both lightweight and modern.

This package will install a basic system with a login screen, LXDE desktop
and a decent amount of applications for daily use and settings.

If you don't like the standard Raspbian packages and would like to install 
your favorite applications on top of the LXDE desktop then this script will
help you past the command-line part, straight to the graphical desktop.


This package might give some people a headache since you might miss some 
features you are used to have in LXDE. These can all be installed separately
using apt-get. Your best bet is to search google to find names of packages
based on description. 
It might take you a little while to gather everything you need but once it
is as you like it you've got your own fine-tuned Raspbian.
