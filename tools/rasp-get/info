Wrapper script for multiple Linux package managers like apt-get and Pacman. 
It's purpose is to provide basic PM functionality so new users can 
use the same simple commands on multiple distributions. 

Also it's quite handy when making scripts who are able to run on 
multiple distributions without customizations using the distro's 
native packagemanager. 

Originaly developed for the RaspberryPi and the most popular OS' 
available for the Pi but it can easily be extended to support 'all' 
Unix OS that make use of package management.
