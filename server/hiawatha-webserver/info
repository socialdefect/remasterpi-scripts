Hiawatha is an extremely fast webserver and also very lightweight. 
It is truly made for your Pi. Another big advantage of hiawatha is that
it's code is very secure and stable. No single person has managed to
break trough it's defenses in any way.

Configuring Hiawatha is not all that hard to do, just take a look at:
http://www.hiawatha-webserver.org/howto to see what's possible and how 
to get there.

This script does configure php to work with hiawatha but you will have to do
the finetuning yourself. 


What does this script install??

	- Hiawatha webserver
	- php5-fcgi
	- working webserver @ your local raspi ip address
As you see this is the bare minimum so if you need support for something
use apt-get to install the required php5 modules.
